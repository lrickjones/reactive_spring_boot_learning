= Hacking with Spring Boot API Portal

when you create a web service, developers want to see ho to use it. Thanks to Spring REST Docs, you can generate all

:snippets: ../../../target/generated-snippets

By running the following request:

include::{snippets}/findAll/curl-request.adoc[]

...the 'ApiItemController' will yield the following response:

include::{snippets}/findAll/response-body.adoc[]

Fan of HTTPie? You can issue the following command:

include::{snippets}/findAll/httpie-request.adoc[]

...and get the same response. Like Chuck-A-Rama, the choice is yours
